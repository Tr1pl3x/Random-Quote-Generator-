**Youtube**: Tutorials from this yt channel [Great Stack](https://www.youtube.com/@GreatStackDev) are a great source of help and this project is heavily inspired by youtuber, [Coding with Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithLewis) in the first place.

### Updates
*  **31/05/2024**
    * A new button is added in the website to toggle between dark mode and light mode. The website will initally load in light mode and switched when the button is triggered.
* **01/06/2024**
    * Deafult image is set to ```./assets/default-background.webp```. Integrated a new button to fetch a new image that will become the background of the quote box.
    * Image generator is used from **Unsplash API**. Although the API offers a range of features, the limit is capped at 50 per hour so I might have to search for a new free api with higher cap limit.
